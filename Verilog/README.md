# James Sharman Pipelined CPU in Verilog
This Verilog folder contains unwritten Verilog files and subfolders with a PCB module as Verilog with a testbench and simulation result waveform. I have done my best to check the functionality against James' testing, but some modules may have bugs in at this stage. At the time of this commit, modules have only been tested stand-alone, and not linked together.
